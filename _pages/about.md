I am a data-driven problem solver with a passion for GenAI and Recommendation Systems. I hold a Master’s in [Electrical Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/electrical-and-computer-engineering) from [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/), where I specialized in High-Performance Machine Learning, Generative AI, Big Data, and Wireless Communications. I graduated with distinction in 2023 with a B.Tech in [Electronics and Communication Engineering](https://vit.ac.in/schools/school-of-electronics-engineering) from [VIT University](https://vit.ac.in/).

I am passionate about Generative AI techniques that blend domain expertise with deep learning. I enjoy exploring AI Agents (with guardrails) and RAGs to build safe, robust, and explainable systems. My work also spans Recommendation Systems, Distributed Deep Learning, and probabilistic models.

I am part of [NYU WIRELESS](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/centers/nyu-wireless) at [NYU Tandon](https://engineering.nyu.edu/) where I was advised by Prof. [Sundeep Rangan](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/sundeep-rangan) to work on developing advanced machine learning models for sub-6G channel estimation. I have also worked at [Johnson & Johnson](https://thenext.jnjmedtech.com/), [ISRO](https://www.isro.gov.in/) and [Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.](https://www.iocl.com/) which provided me with hands-on experience in wireless communications, quantum key distribution, AI/ML, network security, and managing large-scale data.

**I am interested in exploring roles involving Data Science, Big Data Analytics, GenAI and Recommendation Systems.**

<!-- ***Data Science & Generative AI. Understanding the "black box" in AI.***

I’m a data-driven problem solver passionate about Generative AI and AI Agents. I hold a Master’s in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/electrical-engineering-department) from [Columbia University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University), specializing in Machine Learning, Generative AI, NLP, and Big Data. I completed my B.Tech. from [VIT University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vellore_Institute_of_Technology) in 2023, graduating with distinction.

My interests include Generative AI techniques that facilitates the integration of domain knowledge and deep learning models. I am passionate about exploring how AI Agents(with guardrails) and RAGs can foster safe, robust, and explainable AI. I have also worked on other topics like Recommendation Systems, LLM finetuning and probabilistic models.

I was part of [DitecT lab](https://www.columbia.edu/~yf2578/) at [Columbia Engineering](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu) and I was advised by Dr. [Sharon Di](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty-staff/directory/sharon-di) & [Zhaobin Mo](https://zhaobinmo.github.io) where I developed a custom R-CNN model for autonomous vehicles to generate control signals and reducing data volume by 32% via Data distillation.

During my summer internship at Nokia, I designed an MLP-Mixer Autoencoder for 6G networks at [Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/), cutting model parameters by 50%, and fine-tuned LLMs to save 25+ hours on document summarization. Prior to Columbia University I have also worked at [ISRO](https://www.isro.gov.in/) and [Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Oil_Corporation) which gave me hands-on experience in AI, network security, and Data engineering.

My leadership as a PDL Fellow at Columbia University and volunteer work with the Blind People’s Association reflect my commitment to societal impact.

I am interested in exploring roles involving Data Science & Analytics, Generative AI, AI Agents and Recomendation systems.

<!-- Hi, 

I’m Apurva Patel — a data-driven problem solver with a passion for transforming cutting-edge technology into real-world solutions. I recently graduated with a Master’s in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/electrical-engineering-department) from [Columbia University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University), where I specialized in Machine Learning, Generative AI, NLP, and Big Data Analytics. My academic journey has been shaped by a relentless curiosity for solving complex challenges, and my work reflects a commitment to driving meaningful innovation.

At Columbia, I’ve had the privilege of merging theory with practice. As a Graduate Research Assistant, I developed a custom R-CNN architecture to optimize control signal generation for autonomous vehicles, achieving a 32% reduction in data volume through advanced data distillation techniques. My experience as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for Big Data Analytics and Data Visualization enabled me to mentor over 150+ students, sharing insights and fostering a collaborative learning environment.

Professionally, I’ve worked on the frontier of technology at [Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/), where I designed a MLP-Mixer based Autoencoder for 6G channel data compression, outperforming industry benchmarks with a 50% reduction in model parameters. I’ve also fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to streamline tasks like document summarization, saving teams 25+ hours.

My journey began at Vellore Institute of Technology, where I graduated as a Dean’s List scholar, ranked 4<sup>th</sup> out of 155 students. My internships at [ISRO](https://www.isro.gov.in/) and [Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Oil_Corporation) gave me hands-on experience in AI, network security, and data acquisition, fueling my passion for leveraging technology to solve critical problems.

Beyond academics and work, I’ve cultivated leadership skills as a PDL Fellow and Department Representative at Columbia, leading initiatives to enhance student experiences. My volunteer work with the Blind People’s Association in India, where I helped teach math and economics to underprivileged communities, underscores my belief in the power of technology and education to drive societal change.

I’m eager to continue pushing the boundaries of AI and machine learning to create scalable, impactful solutions. I am interested in roles involving Data Science & Analytics, Generative AI, AI Agents and Recomendation systems.
