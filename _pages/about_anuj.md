Hi,

I am a data-driven problem solver with a passion for GenAI and Recommendation Systems. I hold a Master’s in [Electrical Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/electrical-and-computer-engineering) from [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/), where I specialized in High-Performance Machine Learning, Generative AI, Big Data, and Wireless Communications. I graduated with distinction in 2023 with a B.Tech in [Electronics and Communication Engineering](https://vit.ac.in/schools/school-of-electronics-engineering) from [VIT University](https://vit.ac.in/).

I am passionate about Generative AI techniques that blend domain expertise with deep learning. I enjoy exploring AI Agents (with guardrails) and RAGs to build safe, robust, and explainable systems. My work also spans Recommendation Systems, Distributed Deep Learning, and probabilistic models.

I am part of [NYU WIRELESS](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/centers/nyu-wireless) at [NYU Tandon](https://engineering.nyu.edu/) where I was advised by Prof. [Sundeep Rangan](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/sundeep-rangan) to work on developing advanced machine learning models for 6G channel estimation. I have also worked at [Johnson & Johnson](https://thenext.jnjmedtech.com/), [ISRO](https://www.isro.gov.in/) and [Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.](https://www.iocl.com/) which gave me hands-on experience in wireless communications, quantum key distribution, AI/ML, network security and handling large volumes of data.

**I am interested in exploring roles involving Data Science, Big Data Analytics, GenAI and Recommendation Systems. **
