Hi, 

I’m Apurva Patel — a data-driven problem solver with a passion for transforming cutting-edge technology into real-world solutions. I recently graduated with a Master’s in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/electrical-engineering-department) from [Columbia University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University), where I specialized in Machine Learning, Generative AI, NLP, and Big Data Analytics. My academic journey has been shaped by a relentless curiosity for solving complex challenges, and my work reflects a commitment to driving meaningful innovation.

At Columbia, I’ve had the privilege of merging theory with practice. As a Graduate Research Assistant, I developed a custom R-CNN architecture to optimize control signal generation for autonomous vehicles, achieving a 32% reduction in data volume through advanced data distillation techniques. My experience as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for Big Data Analytics and Data Visualization enabled me to mentor over 150+ students, sharing insights and fostering a collaborative learning environment.

Professionally, I’ve worked on the frontier of technology at Nokia, where I designed a MLP-Mixer based Autoencoder for 6G channel data compression, outperforming industry benchmarks with a 50% reduction in model parameters. I’ve also fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to streamline tasks like document summarization, saving teams 25+ hours.

My journey began at Vellore Institute of Technology, where I graduated as a Dean’s List scholar, ranked 4<sup>th</sup> out of 155 students. My internships at [ISRO](https://www.isro.gov.in/) and [Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Oil_Corporation) gave me hands-on experience in AI, network security, and data acquisition, fueling my passion for leveraging technology to solve critical problems.

Beyond academics and work, I’ve cultivated leadership skills as a PDL Fellow and Department Representative at Columbia, leading initiatives to enhance student experiences. My volunteer work with the Blind People’s Association in India, where I helped teach math and economics to underprivileged communities, underscores my belief in the power of technology and education to drive societal change.

I’m eager to continue pushing the boundaries of AI and machine learning to create scalable, impactful solutions. I am interested in roles involving Data Science & Analytics, Generative AI, AI Agents and Recomendation systems.
